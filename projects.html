                    [CS400 / PROGRAMMING III]
                    <ul>
                        <li>Engineered an Interactive application in Java, 
                            using a Hash Table that allowed users to navigate 
                            through a list of movies and their ratings/genres. 
                            Collaborated with 7 other people, rotating through 
                            roles such as Frontend, Backend, Integration Manager, 
                            and Data Wrangler.
                        </li>
                        <li>Learned and implemented an application that utilized a 
                            Red-Black Tree to navigate and sort a Super Market’s inventory. 
                            Collaborated with 7 other people, rotating through roles such as 
                            Frontend and Backend.
                        </li>
                        <li>Developed and implemented Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find and create 
                            the shortest path between given airports in Java. The User was allowed 
                            to insert required destinations, and create multiple flight paths. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Designed a website through a virtual machine using a combination of 
                            Java, HTML, and JavaScript.
                        </li>

                    [CS354 / MACHINE ORGANIZATION]
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Redesigned a program that dynamically allocated memory in the heap using 
                            pointers in C.
                        </li>
                        <li>Used Assembly Code to further optimize gcc’s compiler.</li>

                        <li>
                            Implemented a program that simulated a stock market using structs and pointers. 
                            Allowed users to buy and sell their stocks and calls while the value of their 
                            portfolios changed day by day.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Designed a Stack Queue that simulated taking turns within a RPG video game.  
                        </li>
                        <li>Developed an Interactive program that simulated a bar that sold various milk products. 
                            Allowed users to create new drink tabs, load old tabs, and pay off outstanding balances in C++.
                        </li>
