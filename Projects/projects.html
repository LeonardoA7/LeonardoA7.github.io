                <dd>- Engineered an Interactive application in Java, using a Hash Table that allowed users to navigate through a list of movies
                    and their ratings/genres. Collaborated with 7 other people, rotating through roles such as Frontend, Backend, Integration
                    Manager, and Data Wrangler.
                </dd>           
                <dd>- Learned and implemented an application that utilized a Red-Black Tree to navigate and sort a Super Market’s inventory.
                    Collaborated with 7 other people, rotating through roles such as Frontend and Backend.
                </dd>
                <dd>- Developed and implemented Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find and create the shortest path between given airports in Java. The
                    User was allowed to insert required destinations, and create multiple flight paths.

                <dd>- Redesigned a program that dynamically allocated memory in the heap using pointers in C.
                </dd>           
                <dd>- Used Assembly Code to further optimize gcc’s compiler.</dd>

                <dd>- Implemented a program that simulated a stock market using structs and pointers. Allowed users to buy and sell their stocks
                    and calls while the value of their portfolios changed day by day.
                </dd>           
                <dd>- Designed a Stack Queue that simulated taking turns within a RPG video game.</dd>
                <dd>- Developed an Interactive program that simulated a bar that sold various milk products. Allowed users to create new drink
                    tabs, load old tabs, and pay off outstanding balances in C++.
